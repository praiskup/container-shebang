Evaluate file by script interpret from automatically spawned container
======================================================================

The point of this project is to make writing scripts that are executed in
container as trivial as writing scripts for evaluating host.

For example:

$ cat script
#! /bin/container-shebang --image fedora:32 --interpret /bin/bash --debug

echo "printing arguments from container"
for arg; do
    echo "=> $arg"
done

$ ./script a b c "c d"
printing arguments from container
=> a
=> b
=> c
=> c d
